			<p id="first" class="text">Hi! My name is <a class="important">Samuel Quesada</a>, a huge enthusiast of video games since I was a little kid. 
				Since I enter university, and discover the world of video game programming, I have made 
				some personal projects. I have found, with a group of colleagues, the indie studio <a class="important">Malaka Studio</a>. 
				Together, we took part in some events like <a class="important">CPCRetrodev 2019</a>, <a class="important">GMTK Jam 2020</a> 
				and <a class="important">SGD Jam II</a>. Thanks to these events, we had some incredible experiences, developed various games 
				and gain some experience in this wonderful industry.

			<p class="text1">
				I have studied in the <a class="important">Univerity of Alicante, Spain</a>, and I have in my own a <a class="important">bachelor's degree</a> in 
				<a class="important"multimedia ingineering></a> 
				with a specialty in <a class="important">video game development</a>. Apart from the video games development, I have also knowledge 
				in general programming, having experience with <a class="important">Java, C, C++, C#, HTML, CSS</a> and <a class="important">JavaScript</a> languages and also 
				some familiarity with <a class="important">PHP</a> and <a class="important">assembly</a>. Proving some of the knowledge, I have made this website 
				by my own (yeah, I know, it's not the best thing in the world, but it's something). In addition, I have worked in a software 
				development project relating with security cameras in <a class="important">Peka Sistemas Informaticos A Medida</a>. 
				Lastly, I have a <a class="important">Cambridge Advanced certificate in English (C1)</a>, so I can defend myself without much trouble in any situation.

			Most of the work I have done in the video game development is as <a class="important">gameplay programmer</a> and 
			<a class="important">AI programmer</a>. I have mostly created all the <a class="important">mechanics</a> in the projects I have been involved, 
			and made a substantial part of the <a class="important">AI behaviour</a>, but I have also made some <a class="important">3D models</a> and 
			some <a class="important">pixel art</a> in some projects, although I'm not an artist myself and I have little to
			no idea on this subject, to be honest. As I said in the Home page, I'm currently looking for
			improving my experiencie in the video game industry, as a junior gameplay programmer, so, 
			if you like my profile and the projects I have done, feel free to <a  class="interest" onclick="openContent()">contact me</a>.
